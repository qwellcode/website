We've developed German language models using LeoLM 13B (built on Llama-2 architecture) specifically optimized for German-language understanding and generation.\n\nAdditionally, we've implemented German document chatbots using h2ogpt technology, enabling organizations to query their document repositories using natural language. These on-premise solutions are crucial for enterprises requiring data sovereignty, especially in regulated industries and government applications.\n\nOur work ensures that powerful AI capabilities can be deployed without sending sensitive data to external cloud services, maintaining complete privacy and compliance with European data protection regulations.",
