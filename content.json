We've also implemented German document chatbots using h2ogpt technology, enabling organizations to query their document repositories with natural language.\n\nThese on-premise solutions are crucial for enterprises requiring data sovereignty, especially in regulated industries and government applications. Our work ensures powerful AI capabilities can be deployed without sending sensitive data to external cloud services.\n\nIntegration with @comput3ai provides high-performance AI inference on GPUs for demanding workloads.",
